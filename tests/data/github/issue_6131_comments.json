    "body": "Thanks for checking.\r\n\r\nI can try, but I suspect it only happens in combination with starting off with a drupal-project. I just tried the last two commands (adding the repo and requiring it) after initializing a new and empty composer.json and then it works fine.\r\n\r\nI guess it is the combination of depending on drupal/core which has the same dependencies as drupal-core-strict, just not as strict. But testing that alone also doesn't really give the same. Whe I just run composer require drupal/core and then try to add mine then I do get conflicts, but they go away after a rm -rf composer.lock vendor/.\r\n\r\nSo as far as I see, it only happens when you actually start of with drupal-project.\r\n\r\n"
